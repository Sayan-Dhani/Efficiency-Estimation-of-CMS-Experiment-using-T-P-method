Description : 
- Estimated the muons reconstruction efficiency of the CMS detector after the reconstruction and isolation cuts.
- Applied the Tag & Probe method, implemented vetoes, calculated invariant mass, transverse momentum(PT), and other distributions, analysed histogram ratios, and fit the data using RooFit to model the signal and background.
- Obtained the detection efficiency to be ~94% from the histogram ratios, satisfied with the statistical model of background with polynomial and signal with Breit-Wigner convoluted with double-sided crystal ball function.
